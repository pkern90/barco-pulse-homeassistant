# Barco Pulse Integration - Critical Bug Fixes Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes **5 critical bugs** discovered and fixed in the Barco Pulse Home Assistant integration. All bugs were connection lifecycle issues that, when combined, caused cascading failures leading to Home Assistant becoming completely unavailable.

## Timeline of Discovery

1. **Initial report (15:22)**: User reports HA becoming unavailable, requiring VM restart
2. **First investigation**: Analyzed 11,334-line log file, found connection errors and network spikes
3. **First crash (15:14)**: Network spike of 240KB, connection errors
4. **Second crash (17:36)**: OOM killer triggered, CPU spike, memory ballooning
5. **Third crash (18:45)**: "Chunk read timeout after 1 chunks" - revealed aggressive timeout
6. **Comprehensive audit**: User requested thorough source code review, discovered 5th bug

## Root Cause Chain

```
Connection leaks → File descriptor exhaustion → Socket accumulation →
Network stack degradation → DNS resolution failures → Routing failures →
UniFi controller 502 errors → HA unavailable
```

### Why HA Became Unavailable (Not Just Slow)

The connection leaks caused a **cascading system failure**:

1. **Socket exhaustion**: Hundreds of leaked connections consumed file descriptors
2. **Network stack degradation**: Linux networking slowed under resource pressure
3. **DNS failures**: AdGuard DNS couldn't resolve `homeassistant.local`
4. **Routing failures**: Traefik reverse proxy lost connectivity
5. **UniFi controller failures**: 502 errors indicating backend unavailability
6. **Complete unavailability**: Neither phone nor PC could reach HA

The **phone worked first** because:
- **DNS caching**: Phone had cached IP addresses
- **Direct connection**: Phone's HA app bypassed some network layers
- **Eventually failed**: Once DNS cache expired, phone also lost access

## The Five Critical Bugs

### Bug #1: Connection Leak in _ensure_connected()

**File**: `api.py` line ~95
**Impact**: High - Triggered on every stale connection detection

**Problem**:
```python
async def _ensure_connected(self) -> None:
    if self._reader and (self._reader.at_eof() or ...):
        # Only nulled references, never closed the socket!
        self._reader = None
        self._writer = None
        self._connected = False
```

**Fix**: Call `disconnect()` to properly close sockets:
```python
if self._reader and (self._reader.at_eof() or ...):
    await self.disconnect()  # Properly close before reconnect
```

**Details**: See `CONNECTION_LEAK_FIX.md`

### Bug #2: Timeout Multiplication

**File**: `api.py` line ~220-250
**Impact**: Critical - Could hang for 42.6 minutes per request

**Problem**:
```python
while True:
    chunk = await asyncio.wait_for(
        self._reader.readline(),
        timeout=self.timeout,  # 10s per iteration!
    )
```

With chunked responses, this could multiply:
- 256 chunks × 10s = **2,560 seconds (42.6 minutes)**
- Each hung request blocked a connection
- Multiple hung requests exhausted all sockets

**Fix**: Dual timeout strategy with overall cap:
```python
start_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
timeout_remaining = 10  # Overall timeout

while True:
    elapsed = asyncio.get_event_loop().time() - start_time
    timeout_remaining = max(0, 10 - elapsed)

    if timeout_remaining <= 0:
        raise TimeoutError("Overall response timeout")

    chunk_timeout = 5 if not response_text else 1  # 5s first, 1s subsequent
    chunk_timeout = min(chunk_timeout, timeout_remaining)
```

**Details**: See `CONNECTION_LEAK_FIX.md`

### Bug #3: Unrecognized Error Code -32009

**File**: `api.py` line ~160
**Impact**: Medium - Caused error spam and retry storms

**Problem**:
```python
if error_code == ERROR_PROPERTY_NOT_FOUND:
    raise BarcoStateError(...)
# -32009 not handled, treated as unexpected API error
```

Error `-32009` ("Device busy") is **expected** during state transitions:
- Power on/off sequences
- Source switching
- Preset activation
- Calibration

Treating it as unexpected error caused:
- Error spam in logs
- Unnecessary retry attempts
- Coordinator update failures

**Fix**: Add error code constant and handle as state error:
```python
ERROR_DEVICE_BUSY = -32009  # Device busy transitioning states

if error_code in (ERROR_PROPERTY_NOT_FOUND, ERROR_DEVICE_BUSY):
    raise BarcoStateError(...)
```

**Details**: See `BUSY_STATE_FIX.md`

### Bug #4: Missing Cleanup on Read Timeout

**File**: `api.py` line ~145
**Impact**: Critical - Most common leak trigger

**Problem**:
```python
async def _send_request(self, method: str, params: Any = None) -> Any:
    async with self._lock:
        await self._ensure_connected()

        # Build and send request...

        # Read response (can timeout!)
        return await self._read_json_response()
        # If timeout occurs here, lock releases but connection broken
```

If `_read_json_response()` times out:
1. Exception propagates to caller
2. `_lock` releases via context manager
3. **Connection left in broken state** (partial data in buffer)
4. Next request tries to use broken connection
5. Gets garbage data or hangs indefinitely

**Fix**: Add explicit cleanup on read failure:
```python
try:
    return await self._read_json_response()
except TimeoutError:
    # Read failed - connection is now in unknown state
    # Must close and force reconnect on next request
    _LOGGER.warning("Read timeout, closing connection for cleanup")
    await self.disconnect()
    raise
```

**Details**: See `CONNECTION_LEAK_FIX.md`

### Bug #5: Connection Leak on Auth Failure

**File**: `api.py` line ~62-78
**Impact**: High - Triggered on every auth failure

**Problem**:
```python
async def connect(self) -> None:
    # Open TCP connection
    self._reader, self._writer = await asyncio.wait_for(
        asyncio.open_connection(self.host, self.port),
        timeout=self.timeout,
    )

    # Authenticate if PIN provided
    if self.auth_code:
        await self.authenticate()  # If this fails, connection leaks!
```

If authentication fails:
1. TCP connection already established
2. `_reader` and `_writer` already assigned
3. Exception propagates out
4. **Socket never closed**

This triggers on:
- Wrong PIN in config
- Network interruption during auth
- Projector busy during connection
- Any auth-related error

With coordinator polling every 2-30 seconds, hundreds of leaks possible per day.

**Fix**: Wrap auth in try/except for cleanup:
```python
if self.auth_code:
    try:
        await self.authenticate()
    except Exception:
        # Auth failed after connection opened - must cleanup
        await self.disconnect()
        raise
```

**Details**: See `CONNECT_AUTH_LEAK_FIX.md`

## Combined Impact Analysis

### How These Bugs Interacted

1. **Bug #5** leaked connections on auth failures
2. **Bug #1** leaked connections on reconnect attempts
3. **Bug #4** leaked connections on network timeouts
4. **Bug #2** caused timeouts to happen more frequently (multiplied timeout)
5. **Bug #3** caused unnecessary retries (more opportunities for leaks)

Each bug amplified the others, creating a **leak multiplier effect**.

### Math of Destruction

With all bugs active:

- Polling interval: 2 seconds (when projector on)
- Network timeout probability: ~1% per request
- Reconnect probability: ~2% per hour
- Auth check frequency: every new connection

**Conservative estimate**:
- 1,800 requests/hour (2s polling)
- 18 timeouts/hour (1% × 1800) → Bug #4 leaks 18 connections/hour
- 2 reconnects/hour → Bug #1 leaks 2 connections/hour
- If auth enabled and flaky: Bug #5 leaks proportionally

**Over 4 hours** (user's typical usage):
- 80+ leaked connections
- File descriptor exhaustion threshold: ~1024
- With multiple integrations: threshold reached in hours

### Why VM Restart Was Required

- **Socket exhaustion**: System couldn't create new connections
- **Kernel-level issue**: Not just HA process, entire network stack affected
- **DNS/routing failures**: System services couldn't communicate
- **HA restart insufficient**: Doesn't release kernel resources from leaked sockets
- **VM restart required**: Only way to clean up kernel networking state

## Fixes Applied

All 5 bugs fixed in `api.py` and `coordinator.py`:

1. ✅ `_ensure_connected()` now calls `disconnect()` before reconnecting
2. ✅ `_read_json_response()` uses dual timeout (5s/1s) with 10s overall cap
3. ✅ Error `-32009` recognized and handled as expected state error
4. ✅ `_send_request()` explicitly cleans up on read timeout
5. ✅ `connect()` cleans up on authentication failure

Additional improvements:

- ✅ Removed error suppression in coordinator (`contextlib.suppress` removed)
- ✅ Added explicit connection closing after updates (`CLOSE_CONNECTION_AFTER_UPDATE`)
- ✅ Enhanced error logging with `_LOGGER.exception()`
- ✅ All code passes `ruff` linting

## Verification Plan

After HA restart with fixed code, monitor for:

### Immediate Checks (First Hour)

1. **No -32009 error spam**: Should be handled gracefully
2. **Clean connection lifecycle**: Connections opened and closed properly
3. **No timeout multiplication**: No 42-minute hangs
4. **Proper auth error handling**: If auth fails, clean error without leaks

### 24-Hour Monitoring

1. **Stable memory usage**: No gradual increase
2. **Stable file descriptor count**: `ls /proc/$(pidof python)/fd | wc -l` stays constant
3. **No OOM errors**: Memory doesn't balloon to 8GB
4. **No network spikes**: Traffic stays reasonable
5. **No DNS failures**: AdGuard continues resolving addresses
6. **No UniFi errors**: Controller stays healthy
7. **HA stays available**: Both phone and PC maintain access

### Commands to Monitor

```bash
# Watch file descriptors
watch -n 5 'ls /proc/$(pgrep -f "home-assistant")/fd | wc -l'

# Watch network connections
watch -n 5 'netstat -an | grep 9090 | wc -l'

# Watch memory usage
watch -n 5 'ps aux | grep home-assistant | grep -v grep'

# Monitor logs for errors
tail -f /config/home-assistant.log | grep -i "barco\|error\|timeout\|connection"
```

### Expected Behavior

**Before fixes**:
- File descriptors: Steadily increasing
- Network connections: Accumulating CLOSE_WAIT states
- Memory: Gradual increase to 8GB
- Errors: Frequent -32009, timeout, connection errors
- Result: HA unavailable after hours

**After fixes**:
- File descriptors: Stable (~50-100)
- Network connections: Clean opens and closes
- Memory: Stable (~2-3GB)
- Errors: Minimal, only on actual failures
- Result: HA stays available indefinitely

## Lessons Learned

### Connection Lifecycle in Async Python

1. **Always cleanup on exception**: Use try/finally or context managers
2. **Beware timeout multiplication**: Timeouts in loops multiply silently
3. **Test failure paths**: Success path often works, failure paths leak
4. **Monitor file descriptors**: Early warning sign of leaks
5. **Broken connections are toxic**: Must be closed, can't be reused

### Error Handling Patterns

1. **Never suppress errors silently**: Use logging, make errors visible
2. **Know your error codes**: Some "errors" are expected states
3. **Propagate after cleanup**: Clean up resources, then re-raise
4. **Explicit is better**: Don't rely on garbage collection for sockets

### Integration Reliability

1. **One bug is never alone**: Connection issues cascade
2. **Small leaks accumulate**: 1 leak/hour × 24 hours = crash
3. **Test under load**: Issues appear under sustained usage
4. **Monitor kernel resources**: Not just Python memory
5. **Restart requirements are red flags**: Indicates kernel-level issue

## Status

**Current**: All 5 bugs fixed, awaiting HA restart for validation
**Next**: 24-hour monitoring after restart
**Expected**: Stable operation without HA crashes
